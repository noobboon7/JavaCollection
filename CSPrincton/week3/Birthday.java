/*
Birthday problem:  Suppose that people enter a room one at a time. How people must enter until two share a birthday?
Counterintuitively, after 23 people enter the room, there is approximately a 50–50 chance that two
share a birthday. This phenomenon is known as the birthday problem or birthday paradox.
-----------------------------------Instructions-------------------------------
Write a program Birthday.java that takes two integer command-line arguments n and trials and performs
the following experiment, trials times:
Choose a birthday for the next person, uniformly at random between 0 and n−1.
Have that person enter the room.
---------------------------------Conditions---------------------------------------------
If that person shares a birthday with someone else in the room, stop; otherwise repeat.
In each experiment, count the number of people that enter the room. Print a table that summarizes
the results (the count i, the number of times that exactly i people enter the room, and
the fraction of times that i or fewer people enter the room)
for each possible value of i from 1 until the fraction reaches (or exceeds) 50%.
